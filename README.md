# How to run

You have to run a proxy to igdb that allows CORS for this project to work. Such proxy can be found at https://github.com/simontravancas/igdb-cors-proxy

After you have the igdb proxy server running, run `yarn start` to start this project

Things are hard-coded for now, if you just want to compare 2 profiles look at the `src/components/GamesDigest.tsx` file
